  if you put return it means that function stops there. After return nothing happens. It is like break in switch.

  row 2-3 you need to specify the type with capital: Number. input type="number" in HTML is for the user, he canÂ´t enter letters. JS reads the value as string unless we tell JS to read it as Number. */
